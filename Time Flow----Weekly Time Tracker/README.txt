This is my weekly data from Toggl Track, the time tracking software. I want to record my time logs and share them on GitHub with everyone, so we can motivate and encourage each other.

To be honest, I've started quite late on this path I'm taking. But the outcome is still undecided, and I hope to do my best to make up for everything.
